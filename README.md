Problem:

Please create a REST API in Python using Flask to read (Get) and write (Post, Delete, Put) the local excel file "books.xlsx."

Please make sure to bundle all the API dependencies to be usable.

Please include code snippets showing an example for each use case.

It was from the 'Python Technologist Application Test' of Nagwa Company.

And this project was my answer.


To proceed:
# in CMD
- pipenv install -r requirements.txt
- pipenv shell
- set FLASK_APP=app
- set FLASK_ENV=development
- flask db_create
- flask db_seed
- flask run
Then open the "code_snippets.ipynb" to check the API with code snippets showing an example for each use case.
